Comments: [M814-ModuleChair] Add comments below, making sure to include your initials in [] at the start.
[MS] the ability to input tickets is purposefully vague to avoid placing constraints, it may be decided to use ticket codes, or selection of owned tickets. This is a separate usability NFR
[YI] This fit criteria is excellent. The purposed vagueness should be helpful to create more flexible solution to meet the requirement
[MD] Agree with intent of fit criterion. I would suggest a re-wording for clarity "It should take no more than 3 minutes for 95% of customers to locate their ticket purchases and specify the tickets they wish to submit for a refund.
