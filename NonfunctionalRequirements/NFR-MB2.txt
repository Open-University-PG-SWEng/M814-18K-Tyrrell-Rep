[AJ] Good one. I Since in this specific version of the requirements card there is no date or any other extra info, I would be more specific on what ‘current’ is by either adding a date or, even better, a reference to such standards.
[MB] Good point AJ, it is too vague. Would 'latest available' work here instead. That way it catches all of the latest standards or protocols. If i put a date that can become obsolete.
