REQ-ID: GC2_NFR1
Description: Only authorised members can manually reallocate tickets from the waiting list
Type: Security
Rationale: People with access to the system and who are not part of the reallocation program should not be able to access the waiting list of reallocate tickets from it. 
Fit Criterion: Unauthorised members of the system are not allowed to view or act on the ticket reallocation waiting list. Only authorised members can view and allocate tickets within the system.

[MB] Allows for authorised members of the project development team to check tickets before allocating to the waiting list. The non-functional requirement is good due to privacy regulations, limits the chances of fraud occuring and minimises the risks of issues occuring by limiting access to key individuals.
