Comments: [M814-ModuleChair] Add comments below, making sure to include your initials in [] at the start.
Comments: [SA] Is this not a functional requirement defining what a function must do? however i do see that the overal goal is based on the user experience, perhaps the description should be more generic about the customer should not be in a worse position than they started out with or words to that effect, but keep your Rationale and Fit Criterion
Comments: [JS] I agree that this is a function requirement. Maybe another approach is to provide a non-function requirement specifying how long the refund should take to be processed for example.
[PS] I agree upon the discussion that this is a functional requirement. Two things I would like to add: Polly (represented by Sebasti√°n) already announced the possibility to add admin fees for the return, therefore it is not guaranteed that a full refund will be made.(https://learn2.open.ac.uk/mod/forumng/discuss.php?d=2849288#p20344023). Regarding the idea to constraint the duration of the refund you should keep in mind that in TMA1 we got the information that payments will be processed by a separate, already existing system.
