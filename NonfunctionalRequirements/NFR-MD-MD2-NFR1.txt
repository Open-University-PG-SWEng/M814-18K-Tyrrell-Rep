Comments: [M814-ModuleChair] Add comments below, making sure to include your initials in [] at the start.
Comments: [SA] Is this not a functional requirement defining what a function must do? however i do see that the overal goal is based on the user experience, perhaps the description should be more generic about the customer should not be in a worse position than they started out with or words to that effect, but keep your Rationale and Fit Criterion
Comments: [JS] I agree that this is a function requirement. Maybe another approach is to provide a non-function requirement specifying how long the refund should take to be processed for example.
