Description: Real-time inventory must be able to handle containing a high capacity of tickets
Type: 12 (Performance requirement)

Originator: Daniel Wright - DW2
Comments: [Joseph Magnall] Added this non-functional requirement.
[PS] In general a goog NFR but you need to be more specific. Even a text file could serve the database for 10k tickets if you do not specify timings. You should mention something like 'In 95% of the cases the real-time inventory is able to locate 5 tickets out of 1.000.000 tickets for 500 users in parallel in 200 ms. The reminder will not take longer than 2 seconds'
