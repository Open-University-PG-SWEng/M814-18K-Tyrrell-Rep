Duplicate requirements
 GC2: Overlapping with JS1. I keep JS1 as the case study does not mention that it would be allocated for customer on a waiting list.
 MS2: Overlapping with JS1/GC2. I keep JS1 as it focuses on what product shall do.
 YI1: Overlapping with SA2. I keep SA2 as it simply describes what product shall do with a single verb.
 YI2: Overlapping with JS1/GC2/MS2. I keep JS1 as it focuses on what product shall do with a single verb.
 YJ2: Overlapping with JS1/GC2/MS2/YI2. I keep JS1 as it focuses on what product shall do with a single verb.
 AJ1:Overlapping with JS1/GC2/MS2/YI2/YJ2. I keep JS1. Because the case study does not mention the specific allocation method described by AJ1.
